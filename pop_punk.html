	<h1 class="speech">Kurt</h1>

	<p class="speech">
		I was running many ideas through my mind
		about what I wanted to say to you on your graduation
		from the course here at Syracuse.
</p>

<p class="speech">
As part of very effective procrastination campaign,
I started watching HBOs “Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck”
documentary.
</p>

<p class="speech">
I’ve always been fascinated by people who create
and make new things by combining things
we never thought could --- or should -- be combined.
</p>

<p class="speech">
Nirvana was like that for me.
</p>

<p class="speech">
Light and Heavy.
</p>

<p class="speech">
Pop and Punk.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	I had heard sort-of similar music before -- like the Pixies --
	but it never really reached me --
	it never communicated to me in the way Nirvana did
	-- and at times -- does.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	So this documentary grabbed my attention.
	The story was interesting to me.
	But the way the documentary was told fascinated me.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	It’s authentic with the expected home videos.
	It’s full of context with multiple interviews
	with family and friends
	and their 20 years of hindsight and reflection.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	And then there’s what really got me:
	Kurt Cobain’s art.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Audio recordings of him telling stories
	and working through his creative process of making music.
	Animated segments of sketches
	and drawings from Cobain’s notebooks.
	Sections highlighting his letters,
	journal entries, lyrics
	and random thoughts.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Kurt Cobain was a mixed media artist.
	He wrote. He drew. He designed. And he made music.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Seeing his work --
	and hearing more than just his published songs --
	provided me a new way to understand his story.
</p>

<h1 class="speech">Storytelling Skills</h1>

<p class="speech">
	This is something many of us in the Navy
	have been thinking about.
	How can we provide a new way
	to help people better understand our story?
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Part of the answer is you -- our Syracuse graduates.
	We believe the education you receive here --
	and the mentorship you will provide
	to others when you leave --
	can help us tell our story better.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Your work in storytelling through multimedia,
	writing, sound production, design, photojournalism
	and broadcasting builds a tremendous foundation.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	The challenge for each of you will be
	how you apply all this when you return to the Fleet.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Will you be able to translate
	the storytelling skills you developed here
	to the types of stories
	you’ll be asked to produce in the Fleet?
</p>

<h1 class="speech">Mozart</h1>

<p class="speech">
	It reminds me of a story
	a famous musician found himself
	in back in the late 1700s.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	At the age of 17 or 18, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
	landed a job in Salzburg, Austria
	as the court musician and composer.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	This was a job his father had set up
	with the Archbishop in order to keep a steady flow
	of money coming into the Mozart family.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	The job though didn’t sit well with Mozart.
	He had spent his youth travelling Europe
	with his family playing for Kings and Queens,
	meeting and learning from the leading minds in music,
	playing and composing in every conceivable genre,
	listening to the best orchestras,
	and watching Italian Operas.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	And now he was relegated to life in Salzburg.
	Isolated from the European centers of music.
	Asked to play and compose music he felt
	was dead and conventional
	and had no way of stirring emotions
	or being expressive.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	I guess you can say Mozart was being asked
	to compose something like
	a Navy dot Mil story
	or a general military news article for his time.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	He ended up moving to Vienna though
	where he began creating at an intense rate.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	He used the knowledge he gained travelling Europe
	and playing all those different genres to his advantage.
	He started to stretch the boundaries
	of traditional music and transform those songs
	in ways no one had ever heard.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	He found ways to make his music powerful and expressive
	and broke away from the style of music
	people had grown to expect.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	You see, back then the piano concerto and symphony
	had become light and pop-like genres
	with short and simple movements and a lot of melody.
	To Mozart, it all must have sounded
	a lot like elevator music.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	So, Mozart reworked those forms from within.
	He composed works for larger orchestras.
	He expanded the violin sections.
	His works gave the orchestra a more powerful sound
	and he established tension and dissonance
	that would build and build to a climax
	and then reveal a grand
	and dramatic finale.
</p>

<p class="speech">
Light and Heavy.
</p>

<p class="speech">
Pop and Punk.
</p>

<h1 class="speech">Content that is Pop and Punk</h1>

<p class="speech">
	We’re trying to create something similar for the Navy.
	Let’s say it’s our version
	of Light and Heavy.
	Pop and Punk.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	We’re on a mission
	to create Navy content that is both.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	We need fast and easy-to-digest content.
	Quick. Light. “Ok. Got it”- type stories,
	information summaries,
	short videos,
	informational posters.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Content that is like pop music:
	Accessible to many;
	easy to understand
	and easy to remember.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Content that is mobile,
	social, visual and shareable.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Content that is produced
	and released now -- as it happens.
	Not in an hour. Not in a day.  But now.
	As quick as we can get it out
	and be accurate and clear.
</p>

<p class="speech">
You know. Pop music.
</p>

<h1 class="speech">Sonny Moore</h1>

<p class="speech">
	A musician who’s been really good
	at getting in on the “now” is Sonny Moore.
	He was the lead singer of the band “From First to Last”
	from 2004 to 2006.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	The group mixed Emo and Hardcore --
	imagine confessional and expressive lyrics
	with fast, heavy and abrasive punk.
	It’s a different way of thinking about light and heavy.
	Pop and Punk.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Well, Sonny was plugged in.
	He met his band on MySpace
	when it was the largest social networking site
	in the world.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	They marketed their album through social media
	and started booking shows
	through connections they made online.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	As social media began to break
	and become a monster force,
	so did “From First To Last.”
</p>

<p class="speech">
	They were booked on the Vans Warped Tour
	and got bigger and bigger
	as they promoted their social media pages
	at all their concerts.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Of course, trends move fast.
	MySpace died. “From First To Last” faded.
	And Sonny Moore left the band,
	rented a warehouse in L.A.
	and started playing on his computer.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	He started creating Electronic Dance Music
	and posting it online for free.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	He continued to promote his work on social media
	and started playing parties.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	He was offered a major breakthrough job
	remixing a Lady Gaga song…
	and started calling himself Skrillex.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	His take on electronic dance music
	and dubstep became big.
	Very big.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	He took the genre to a new place
	as he mixed pop dance music with heavy deep bass drops
	and wobble that became his signature sound.
</p>

<p class="speech">
Light and Heavy.
</p>

<p class="speech">
Pop and Punk.
</p>

<h1 class="speech">Skrillex</h1>

<p class="speech">
	What’s amazing about Skrillex to me
	is how he has been able to ride
	on different pop and punk waves
	and his ability to combine mulitple trends.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	What’s also amazing is
	he doesn’t stick with just one way.
	He moves in and out of trends
	and finds new ways
	to connect with his fans.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Skrillex understands that pop trends shift.
	What’s popular and meaningful now
	may not be useful in a day.
</p>

<p class="speech">
The shelf-life of pop is natually short.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	As we create our pop stories
	that are accessible to many;
	easy to understand
	and easy to remember;
	we can’t forget that much of it is disposable.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Content that is mobile, social, visual and shareable
	is also inheritantly expendable.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	I have no idea what was in my Twitter feed an hour ago.
	I never scroll all the way down my Facebook feed
	to see what happened yesterday.
</p>

<h1 class="speech">We Need the Punk</h1>

<p class="speech">
	This is why we need the heavy.
	In addition to the Pop, we need the Punk.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	And this is where you
	and the particular skills you learned here
	come in to play the most.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Mozart’s expanded orchestras and violin sections
	are like storytelling details and color.
	It adds richness and context.
	It fills the mind
	and can create powerful,
	moving experiences.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Skrillex’s way of understaning
	what resonates with crowds
	allows him to connect to people
	through both rock
	and electronic dance music.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Working in mixed media
	and telling our stories through
	sounds, graphics,
	moving pictures, still images
	and written words
	can provide a depth of understanding --
	a holistic look inside, around, above and below
	the stories we tell.
	Like Kurt Cobain’s mixed media art --
	the more ways we can share,
	the more ways people will have to understand us.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	We need to create these deeper, more contextual
	pieces of work that resonate with our audiences.
	The work can take many forms:
	Written, audio, video
	or multimedia feature stories or series;
	Storytelling narratives;
	Full on documentaries;
	Detailed and data-driven stories and infographics.
</p>

<h1 class="speech">Closure</h1>

<p class="speech">
	Head out to the Fleet
	and embrace both the Pop and the Punk.
	Listen and seek to understand your audiences.
	Find ways to resonate with them
	and make something new
	by combining styles, media,
	and communication channels
	in ways we don’t think is possible.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Build your own Montage of Heck;
	Symphony of expression;
	connection to the now.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Find your own balance
	between the Pop and the Punk
	and sing it to all who’ll listen.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	The foundation has been built.
	It’s now up to you to rework
	our media world from within.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Let’s use the pop to bring people in
	and use the punk to take their breath away.
