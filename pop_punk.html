I was running many ideas through my mind
about what I wanted to say to you on your graduation
from the course here at Syracuse.

As part of very effective procrastination campaign,
I started watching HBOs “Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck”
documentary.

I’ve always been fascinated by people who create
and make new things by combining things
we never thought could --- or should -- be combined.

Nirvana was like that for me.
Light and Heavy.
Pop and Punk.

I had heard sort-of similar music before -- like the Pixies --
but it never really reached me --
it never communicated to me in the way Nirvana did
-- and at times -- does.

So this documentary grabbed my attention.
The story was interesting to me.
But the way the documentary was told fascinated me.

It’s authentic with the expected home videos.
It’s full of context with multiple interviews
with family and friends
and their 20 years of hindsight and reflection.

And then there’s what really got me:
Kurt Cobain’s art.

Audio recordings of him telling stories
and working through his creative process of making music.
Animated segments of sketches
and drawings from Cobain’s notebooks.
Sections highlighting his letters,
journal entries, lyrics
and random thoughts.

Kurt Cobain was a mixed media artist.
He wrote. He drew. He designed. And he made music.

Seeing his work --
and hearing more than just his published songs --
provided me a new way to understand his story.

This is something many of us in the Navy
have been thinking about.
How can we provide a new way
to help people better understand our story?

Part of the answer is you -- our Syracuse graduates.
We believe the education you receive here --
and the mentorship you will provide
to others when you leave --
can help us tell our story better.

Your work in storytelling through multimedia,
writing, sound production, design, photojournalism
and broadcasting builds a tremendous foundation.

The challenge for each of you will be
how you apply all this when you return to the Fleet.

Will you be able to translate
the storytelling skills you developed here
to the types of stories
you’ll be asked to produce in the Fleet?

It reminds me of a story
a famous musician found himself
in back in the late 1700s.

At the age of 17 or 18, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
landed a job in Salzburg, Austria
as the court musician and composer.

This was a job his father had set up
with the Archbishop in order to keep a steady flow
of money coming into the Mozart family.

The job though didn’t sit well with Mozart.
He had spent his youth travelling Europe
with his family playing for Kings and Queens,
meeting and learning from the leading minds in music,
playing and composing in every conceivable genre,
listening to the best orchestras,
and watching Italian Operas.

And now he was relegated to life in Salzburg.
Isolated from the European centers of music.
Asked to play and compose music he felt
was dead and conventional
and had no way of stirring emotions
or being expressive.

I guess you can say Mozart was being asked
to compose something like
a Navy dot Mil story
or a general military news article for his time.

He ended up moving to Vienna though
where he began creating at an intense rate.

He used the knowledge he gained travelling Europe
and playing all those different genres to his advantage.
He started to stretch the boundaries
of traditional music and transform those songs
in ways no one had ever heard.

He found ways to make his music powerful and expressive
and broke away from the style of music
people had grown to expect.

You see, back then the piano concerto and symphony
had become light and pop-like genres
with short and simple movements and a lot of melody.
To Mozart, it all must have sounded
a lot like elevator music.

So, Mozart reworked those forms from within.
He composed works for larger orchestras.
He expanded the violin sections.
His works gave the orchestra a more powerful sound
and he established tension and dissonance
that would build and build to a climax
and then reveal a grand
and dramatic finale.

Light and Heavy.
Pop and Punk.

We’re trying to create something similar for the Navy.
Let’s say it’s our version
of Light and Heavy.
Pop and Punk.

We’re on a mission
to create Navy content that is both.

We need fast and easy-to-digest content.
Quick. Light. “Ok. Got it”- type stories,
information summaries,
short videos,
informational posters.

Content that is like pop music:
Accessible to many;
easy to understand
and easy to remember.

Content that is mobile,
social, visual and shareable.

Content that is produced
and released now -- as it happens.
Not in an hour. Not in a day.  But now.
As quick as we can get it out
and be accurate and clear.

You know. Pop music.

A musician who’s been really good
at getting in on the “now” is Sonny Moore.
He was the lead singer of the band “From First to Last”
from 2004 to 2006.

The group mixed Emo and Hardcore --
imagine confessional and expressive lyrics
with fast, heavy and abrasive punk.
It’s a different way of thinking about light and heavy.
Pop and Punk.

Well, Sonny was plugged in.
He met his band on MySpace
when it was the largest social networking site
in the world.

They marketed their album through social media
and started booking shows
through connections they made online.

As social media began to break
and become a monster force,
so did “From First To Last.”

They were booked on the Vans Warped Tour
and got bigger and bigger
as they promoted their social media pages
at all their concerts.

Of course, trends move fast.
MySpace died. “From First To Last” faded.
And Sonny Moore left the band,
rented a warehouse in L.A.
and started playing on his computer.

He started creating Electronic Dance Music
and posting it online for free.

He continued to promote his work on social media
and started playing parties.

He was offered a major breakthrough job
remixing a Lady Gaga song…
and started calling himself Skrillex.

His take on electronic dance music
and dubstep became big.
Very big.

He took the genre to a new place
as he mixed pop dance music with heavy deep bass drops
and wobble that became his signature sound.

Light and Heavy.
Pop and Punk.

What’s amazing about Skrillex to me
is how he has been able to ride
on different pop and punk waves
and his ability to combine mulitple trends.

What’s also amazing is
he doesn’t stick with just one way.
He moves in and out of trends
and finds new ways
to connect with his fans.

Skrillex understands that pop trends shift.
What’s popular and meaningful now
may not be useful in a day.

The shelf-life of pop is natually short.

As we create our pop stories
that are accessible to many;
easy to understand
and easy to remember;
we can’t forget that much of it is disposable.

Content that is mobile, social, visual and shareable
is also inheritantly expendable.

I have no idea what was in my Twitter feed an hour ago.
I never scroll all the way down my Facebook feed
to see what happened yesterday.

This is why we need the heavy.
In addition to the Pop, we need the Punk.

And this is where you
and the particular skills you learned here
come in to play the most.

Mozart’s expanded orchestras and violin sections
are like storytelling details and color.
It adds richness and context.
It fills the mind
and can create powerful,
moving experiences.

Skrillex’s way of understaning
what resonates with crowds
allows him to connect to people
through both rock
and electronic dance music.

Working in mixed media
and telling our stories through
sounds, graphics,
moving pictures, still images
and written words
can provide a depth of understanding --
a holistic look inside, around, above and below
the stories we tell.
Like Kurt Cobain’s mixed media art --
the more ways we can share,
the more ways people will have to understand us.

We need to create these deeper, more contextual
pieces of work that resonate with our audiences.
The work can take many forms:
Written, audio, video
or multimedia feature stories or series;
Storytelling narratives;
Full on documentaries;
Detailed and data-driven stories and infographics.

<pre>
Head out to the Fleet
and embrace both the Pop and the Punk.
Listen and seek to understand your audiences.
Find ways to resonate with them
and make something new
by combining styles, media,
and communication channels
in ways we don’t think is possible.

Build your own Montage of Heck;
Symphony of expression;
connection to the now.

Find your own balance
between the Pop and the Punk
and sing it to all who’ll listen.

The foundation has been built.
It’s now up to you to rework
our media world from within.

Let’s use the pop to bring people in
and use the punk to take their breath away.
