	Introduction
	---
	</p>
<pre>
Thank you. Thank you for having me here
today to celebrate our Navy’s 242nd birthday.

“Here's to the crazy ones.  
The misfits.  The rebels.
The troublemakers.
The round pegs in the square holes.
The ones who see things differently.”

Yeah, that’s from Apple’s iconic “Think Different” ad
and it kept playing in my mind as I thought about
what I wanted to share with you
today on our Navy’s 242nd Birthday.

You see, our Navy was built
-- and continues to thrive --
because we ‘think different’.

Creativity, design, and story
are natural components of
our history and heritage.

It goes all the back to our very beginning
when a renegade Quaker from Philadelphia
convinced Secretary of War Henry Knox
to take a chance on a
radical new ship design.

	The Designer
	---
	</p>
<pre>
Joshua Humphreys was a crazy one.

His frigate design went against
every prevailing belief
about Navy ship construction.
Most shipfitters slandered the plans.
Others who saw them believed they
must have been drawn wrong because
no one in their right mind
would design a ship in such a way.

It was 1794 and Congress had authorized
the building of six frigates.
It was a contentious vote because
nearly half of the elected officials
believed we only needed a Navy
for coastal defense.
The other half believed
we needed a blue-ocean Navy
to protect Americans
and American interests
overseas from the Barbary pirates
and other potential threats.

One thing everyone at the time agreed on though
was that the Royal British Navy was a beast.  
It was respected and feared around the world.
It had been operating for centuries and
had six hundred active warships.

It’d be foolish for anyone to ever think
America’s Navy could compete against such might.

Joshua Humphreys must have been foolish then,
because he saw things differently.

He believed the American Navy could hold its own
against any enemy with the right ship design.  

He believed America needed to build a hybrid between
the frigates and battleships of the Royal Navy.

Ian Toll writes in his excellent book
“Six Frigates” that
Humphrey’s “unique insight was that the Europeans,
with their binary fleets composed of battleships
and smaller frigates, had failed to grasp
the advantage of ships
that combined qualities of both.”

He also believed that their oversight exposed
“a tactical weakness that could be exploited
by the Americans in the event of a naval war.”

Mind you, this is 1794 -- more than a decade
after the Revolutionary War ended -- and
nearly 20 years before the War of 1812 began.

	Design = Problem Solving
	---
	</p>
<pre>
Joshua Humphreys was the crazy one
who believed that with the right design,
American Sailors and ships
could compete against the British.

So he designed a ship that could:
outgun the European frigates;
overwhelm a lone enemy cruiser with a
heavy battery of 24-pounder long guns;
and either outrun heavy British battleships,
or could take them on in heavy weather
when the battleship was forced
to stow its lower deck guns.

Humphreys designed a frigate
he believed would enjoy
one of the most important advantages
any warship could ever have:
Giving the Commander Options.
The option to either fight or flee,
to outgun or outrun.

He was putting a round peg into the square hole
of British dominance on the sea.

And his radical ideas didn’t stop with this concept.
  
His large, heavily armed, fast-sailing ships
would be longer than any frigate on the ocean
and they would be built using
an innovative way to
distribute the weight of the ship
across the entire keel.

That innovation would allow it to carry more guns
per displacement than any other ship in the water.

To make it happen, his design called
for making the beams and decks
out of Carolina pine.  
The planks of red cedar.  
And most important,
key pieces of the frame
made of southern live oak.

Live oak is the heaviest oak there is.
As the tree grows, its vascular system
is plugged with a thick gum,
making it dense and as heavy
as 75 pounds per cubic foot.

It’s extraordinarily strong and has an
amazing resistance to both salt air and rot.

Even though it had all these amazing qualities
that made it ideal for shipbuilding,
it wasn’t used much because it was
expensive and hard to obtain.
At the time, southern live oak
was found only in a twenty-mile-wide coastal zone
that stretched from southern Virginia to East Texas.

Humphrey’s genius wasn’t that he was
a great ship designer or builder
-- even though he was both.
His genius was he sought to understand
the nature of the problem --- large
European Battleships and smaller,
but much faster European Frigates --
and then used his skills to solve that problem.

He was also a master of the elements
of shipbuilding.
He knew the characteristics
of different types of timber
and selected combinations that would give him
the exact ship he wanted --- strong and fast.  

Three years after getting the approval
to build the Navy’s first six frigates,
three were completed and launched in 1797.  
The remaining three were completed
two to three years later.

	Proof: The War of 1812
	---
	</p>
<pre>
The genius of their design, however,
wasn’t fully recognized until 1812 though.  
War had broken out with the British and
they flooded American waters
with hundreds of warships.

Everyone thought the American Navy
would be embarrassed at sea
-- but Humphreys ships did exactly
what he believed they could do:  
outgun or outrun the enemy.

In one battle off the coast
of Nova Scotia,
the HMS Guerriere closed in
on one of Humphrey's
frigates and let off a broadside.
The ship’s heavy planks and live oak frame
provided good protection
and as one of Guerrière’s
18-pounder balls bounced
harmlessly back into the sea,
an American Sailor exclaimed:
“Her sides are made of iron!”

The remark was widely reported in the press,
and USS CONSTITUTION’s nickname “Old Ironsides” stuck.

Today's Navy and the Navy MCs
----------
</p>

<pre>
Our Navy history has so many amazing stories
of those who dared to think different.  

We place a high premium on freethinkers.

We value Freedom of Navigation on the seas
and also in the mind.

We are not afraid to innovate
or try something new.

Take a look at all the Mass Communication
Specialists here today.  
Each of you are a product of innovation.  
The merging of four legacy ratings into
MC was innovative at the time.

You know, Humphrey’s story reminds me
a lot of MCs in some other ways.

You all are a lot like Humphrey’s Frigates.  
You’re a hybrid bunch.
Powerful visual communicators,
agile designers,
and able to provide your commander
a range of communication options
executed smartly and swiftly.

The challenge for each you now
is to embrace your role
and keep learning to become
a master of your craft
So you can be the crazy one;
The round peg in the square hole
The one who see things differently.

And shape our Navy’s history.

Happy 242th Birthday U.S. Navy.

Thank you.
