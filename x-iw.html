	    “There is a war out there, old friend- a World War.
	    And it’s not about whose got the most bullets;
	    it’s about who controls the information.”
	    Cosmo, Ben Kingsley’s character
			in the 1992 Film “Sneakers”
</pre>

<pre>
	Not much has changed since 1992 except
	maybe this quote is even more relevant.

	We see it all around the information environment.

	ISIS online recruiting;
	Russian propaganda;
	Chinese political warfare.

	Information is its own warfare domain
	and our competitors and adversaries
	are waging battle there every minute of every day.

	We are very good at influencing and controlling
	two of the three dimensions of the information domain:

	the physical --
	networks, Command and Control facilities,
	communication towers, phones,
	computers and such;

	and the informational --
	the collecting, processing, storing,
	disseminating and protecting of information.

	But we’re not very good at influencing and controlling
	the third dimension of the information domain:

	the cognitive dimension --
	how people process and perceive information,
	make judgments,
	and make decisions on what to think
	and what to believe.

	We lag in this dimension
	partly because
	it’s not in our culture
	and partly because
	our narrative lacks focus.

	We're not going to change the culture part;
	nor should we.

	Since 1791 and
	the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights,
	we’ve enjoyed
	Freedom of Speech
	and Freedom of the Press guarantees.

	Where our adversaries shut down legitimate
	news and press coverage,
	or intimidate,
	silence,
	or even kill dissidents,
	we believe our country is stronger
	with a free press
	and with
	freedom of speech.

	We can however,
	focus our narrative.

	It is imperative for us to communicate
	the overarching narrative of
	the United States of America
	and link everything we do
	and everything we say
	to that narrative.

	To do that,
	I believe we have three communication obligations:

	One, to be transparent about our operations;
	and deliver Operational Truth.

	Two, to ensure what we say
	aligns with what we do;
	and build Transactional Trust.

	and three, to demonstrate who we are,
	as Sailors and Americans;
	by Reinforcing our Values
	in all our communication.


</pre>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:arial;

	Operational Truth
	---
</p>

<pre>
	So what do I mean by “Operational Truth”?

	It means aggressive transparency.

	We must be able to tell and show the world
	what we are doing and why.

	We must be proactive
	in our communication planning
	so we are able to get
	operational truth out
	into the information environment first
	and deny our competitors and adversaries
	informational maneuvering space.

	Being first matters.

	A RAND study on the Russian propaganda model says
	Russia has the agility to be first
	and that gives them the chance
	to create a first impression
	and follow it up with
	continuous multi-channel messaging
	which helps them boost their perceived credibility,
	expertise and trustworthiness.
</pre>

<pre style="text-align:center; font-size:12px; font-family:arial;
color:grey; opacity:0.5;">
		On screen:
			“Russian propaganda has the agility to be first,
			which affords propagandists the opportunity to create
			the first impression. Then, the combination of high-volume,
			multichannel, and continuous messaging makes Russian themes
			more likely to be familiar to their audiences,
			which gives them a boost in terms of perceived credibility,
			expertise, and trustworthiness.”
</pre>

<pre>
	To combat this, we need to immediately be able to tell and show
	our part of the National narrative when asked.

	This means
	we have an obligation to make
	publicly releasable information
	available to national leadership
	to provide context,
	facilitate informed perceptions,
	and counter adversarial propaganda.

	Our units must be able to
	collect, process and forward for release,
	traditional VI like handheld imagery
	from specialized units like
	SNOOPIE, COMCAM and NPASE,
	or non-traditional VI
	from sensors on manned, unmanned
	and remotely piloted platforms
	or other appropriate data
	from GPS to radar tracks.

	We have to view this information
	as a non-kinetic payload
	and empower our communication team
	-- IO and PA –
	to look at every exercise,
	operation or expected encounter
	through this lens.

	We also need to consider when it’s appropriate
	to be more aggressive with releasing information
	about upcoming exercises and operations.

	U.S. SIXTH FLEET did this in June
	when USS Porter was sent into the Black Sea.
	They announced on June 4th the intent to send Porter
	into the Black Sea.

	On June 6th they announced Porter had entered
	and then on the 18th, that Porter had departed.

	Partly because of these releases,
	Russia’s informational maneuver space was limited.
	It’s a smart use of communication strategy
	and aggressive transparency.

	It also helps us build transactional trust.

	Transactional Trust
	---
	</p>

<pre>
	Which brings me to our
	second communication obligation:

	We need to ensure what we say
	aligns with what we do.
	In doing so, we will build
	transactional trust.

	This is trust built over time by being transparent
	and closing transactional loops – big or small.

	We see it all the time with the peer-to-peer economy.
	Yelp!, Airbnb, Uber,

	They’re the new model of peer trust
	and they’re built on decentralized,
	bottom-up, personal reviews and online reputations.
	Transactional Trust.

	People believe crowd-sourced reviews on Yelp!.
	They care about their Airbnb guest reputation
	and Uber passenger rating.

	Trust in this context is not linear
	nor is it controlled by a single source.
	It works up and down; between provider and customer.

	This type of peer trust is growing
	and transparency is a major reason why.
	Doing what you say you’re going to do
	builds transactional trust.

	At a fundamental level,
	our Navy’s own transparent transactions
	may be why Gallup surveys for more than 20 years
	show high levels of public trust
	and confidence for our service.

	Our role is to deploy where needed,
	remain ready to fight and win wars,
	and protect America.

	Through time, there have been clearly visible
	transactions that have built our reputation:

	At-sea battles during World War Two
	The rescue of Captain Phillips
	The raid that brought down Osama bin Laden
	Missile strikes from the sea to protect our Country

	We demonstrate our ability to protect America
	through each transaction.

	But even as powerful as those events are,
	they wouldn’t be able to help
	the Navy build transactional trust
	without some level of transparency
	so people could see those actions,
	understand their context
	and make their own decision
	on whether the Navy is meeting their expectations.

	This is why we communicate with our publics.
	We have to close the transactional loop
	to continue to build trust and understanding over time.

	The PR firm Edelman conducts
	a worldwide trust survey each year.
	Their 2016 report – researched in October of 2015 --
	divides the world into two groups:

	The Informed Public --
	college-educated, top 25 percent income earners
	with significant media consumption habits;

	and then everyone else –
	the mass public,  85% of the world population.

	Edelman’s research shows a growing gap
	between how these two groups view institutions.

	The Informed Public reports
	62 percent trust in
	government, media, business and NGOs,

	while the mass population reports
	less than 50 percent trust
	in those institutions.

	And these surveys were taken a year ago.
	Before BREXIT.
	Before the Presidential Primaries
	and before the General Election season.

	It’ll be interesting to see how those events
	shape trust levels.

	From my seat, it’s alarming to see
	that 85 percent of the world’s population
	distrusts these mainstay institutions.

	This is the audience our adversaries
	are targeting in their information war.

	And it’s not just ‘over there’ in the Middle East,
	Russia or China – they’re also targeting us ---
	our mass population -- right here, right now.

	There are two effective ways of combating
	adversarial propaganda and cyber recruiting.

	One is continuing to close our ‘say-do’ gap
	and build and expand our transactional trust
	relationships.

	The other is providing an alternative to the narrative
	our competitors and adversaries peddle online.

</pre>

<p style="text-align:center; font-family:arial;
color:grey; opacity:0.5; text-transform:uppercase">
	---
	Reinforce our Values
	---
	</p>
<pre>
	We do that by highlighting
	who we are and what we believe;
	By reinforcing our values
	through our actions and our stories.

	Our American Dream is still a beacon of light
	and hope throughout the world.

	Our Navy is a shining example of
	opportunity and progress,
	collaboration and acceptance,
	of being an important part
	of something bigger than yourself.

	We value Toughness, Honesty, Initiative, and Innovation
	and demand Honor, Courage and Commitment.

	And because of that,
	our Sailors grow to become leaders,
	experts in their fields,
	and designers of their own future.

	Our Sailors represent the best in our country,
	Our ideals, hopes and aspirations.

	We need to tell that story.
	It’ll help us combat our adversaries propaganda
	and value-based stories will help us build transactional trust.

	Conclusion
	---
	</p>
<pre>
	Addressing all three dimensions
	of the information domain
	is vital for our ability
	to Project Power Ashore through
	information and communication.

	We are very good at influencing
	the physical and informational dimensions,
	but face challenges
	working within the cognitive dimension.

	And to change that, we must:

	Focus our narrative;

	Deliver Operational Truth
	Build Transactional Trust
	and Reinforce our Values

	Thank you.
