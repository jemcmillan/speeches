Good evening and thank you all for having me.

I had just graduated from Oregon State,
had completed Navy officer training
and was assigned to
Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ONE
in San Diego -- The Fleet Angels.

I was on one of my first helicopter missions --
there to take photographs of training
as part of my duties
as the squadron’s Public Affairs Officer.

I’m proudly wearing my Flight Jacket
with a Fleet Angels patch
sewn over my left pocket
and I’m wearing a borrowed green jumpsuit
as the air crew straps me into a gunner's belt
so I can safely lean out
the helicopter’s side door to take pictures.

I’m on an SH-3 Sea King --
the same kind as Marine ONE -
the President's helicopter.   
Of course ours isn’t as fancy
as the one the President uses.  
It’s pretty utilitarian.
This thing wasn’t sleek.
It wasn’t quiet.
The pilots called it
the War Winnebago.  
But it didn’t matter to me.  
I was flying and I was on a mission!

So I’m all keyed up
to get the best photographs ever.  

Mind you -- I’m not really a photographer.
I know how to point -- and shoot.  
But still, I’m keyed up.
I’m going to get the best photographs
this squadron has ever seen!

I’m crouched down shooting here.  
Leaning over; shooting there.
I get on the helicopter deck
and hang my camera out the door to focus
on the lowering of a rescue basket
when the pilot excitedly barks out
some command I don’t understand.

And the helicopter violently shifts
and just starts dropping.

	      < pause >

straight
down.

	MILITARY CHAIN OF TRUST
	---
</p>

<pre>
Author, TED Talk speaker and optimist
Simon Sinek says
“Trust is absolutely essential
for human survival.”  

I couldn’t agree more!  
When that helicopter
was falling from the sky
-- I was freaked out.
Momentarily scared beyond all belief.

And yet, it was weird because
I trusted the pilot wouldn’t let
that War Winnebago crash into the ocean.  

Or, if he did,
I trusted the aircrew
knew how to handle such a crash
and that they
wouldn’t let us die.

In the military
we require that type of trust.

We have to believe
in the person next to us.

We have to believe in our training
and experience and
all the rules and procedures.
Because if we didn't,
fear would grip us
and prevent us from doing our job.

How could you face the enemy
in a combat zone
if you didn't trust
the Marine next to you?  

How could you land a jet
on an aircraft carrier at night
if you didn't trust the people on deck
guiding you in safely?  

How could you trust flying
an aircraft more than 20 years old
if you didn't trust the maintenance crew?  

Our entire profession
is built on a chain of trust.

That chain is created through
our training,
our shared culture and language,
a common mission and purpose,
through professional
and personal relationships,
and shared experiences
-- good and bad;
fast-paced and exciting;
and monotonous and
watching-paint-dry boring.

That chain of trust
has been tested through war, peace,
military budget increases and cuts,
and cultural shifts in the military
and America.  

And through each test,
it gets stronger.

My experience,
twenty-some years ago
on that helicopter was,
for me,
one of those tests.

       < pause >

For what seemed like the longest
two or three seconds of my life,
we just dropped.

Closer
and closer
to the ocean

      < pause >

And then,
in an instant,
we were just hovering in the air
about 40 feet above the waves.

The pilot was laughing.
The aircrew were smiling.  

Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
It was routine.
Part of the training.  
I wasn’t in on it…
I was the newbie.

Not warning me ahead of time
that they were going to radically maneuver
their helicopter to prepare
for a simulated rescue was a little joke
they played with all the newbies.  

It is part of our military culture
and I’ll never forget that experience,
the capability of that aircraft
and the ability of those pilots.

We strengthened our chain of trust that day.

	LOSING TRUST
	---
	</p>
<pre>
Simon Sinek says trust comes
from a sense of common values and beliefs.

Using that definition,
the military is on some
pretty solid trust ground.  

But what happens if you don’t share
common values and beliefs?  

Does it automatically equate to distrust?  
Looking around today’s environment,
it sure seems it’s starting to look that way.

The giant PR firm Edelman conducts
a worldwide trust survey each year
and they say there’s a widening trust gap
between the mass population
and what Edelman calls the informed public
-- those who are college-educated,
fall in the top 25 percent income bracket
and report significant media consumption.

Edelman says the informed public
-- 15 percent of the world population --
reports increased trust in government,
media, business and NGOs.

While everyone else -- 85 percent of world --
reports less than 50 percent trust
in those institutions.

For communicators, members of the media
and those in the public service sector
-- for us in this room --
the trust gap presents a major challenge.  
We NEED the mass population to trust us.

	THE CHALLENGE
	---
	</p>
<pre>
The Navy believes the American public
has a right to know about their Navy.  
They should be able to see how we are using
the resources they provide
-- their sons, daughters, husbands and wives;
and, through Congress,
the funds that support
our platforms, programs and operations.

If we lose the trust of the American people,
we won’t be able to do our job
protecting our country and our interests.

We need Americans to trust
and believe in the Navy
so they are open to receive information
about what we are doing
and why it’s important to them
so we can recruit smart and innovative thinkers
to make us stronger
so we can diversify our ranks
to take advantage
of their unique backgrounds and experiences.

	TRANSPARENT TRANSACTIONS
	---
	</p>
<pre>
As institutional trust has fallen to historic lows,
a new kind of trust is growing.   
It’s being called “peer trust”
and I believe institutions – even the Navy –
can learn a lot by looking at
how this type of trust works.

We’re all already familiar with in it in some way.   
Airbnb, Uber, Etsy, Yelp!,
They’re the new model of peer trust.
They are all built on decentralized,
bottom-up, personal reviews
and online reputations.
Trust.

We believe crowd-sourced reviews on Yelp!.
We care about our Airbnb guest reputation.
We develop almost personal relationships
with our Etsy artisans.
We care about our Uber rating.

Trust in this context is
not linear nor controlled by a single source.
It works up and down; between provider and customer.

And this type of crowdsourced trust is growing.
A major reason is because
of the transparency of the transaction.

The provider is transparent
about what they are going to provide
-- room,  ride, rustic hand-made gift.  
And the customer is transparent
about who they are, what they want,
and what kind of customer they’ve been in the past.

Over time, with many reviews and ratings,
a reputation picture becomes clear
for both provider and customer.
Everyone knows what they can expect
and trust is further built
when both live up to or exceed the expectations.

At a fundamental level,
transparent transactions may be why the Navy
-- and the military -- enjoys high levels
of public trust and confidence.   

The role of our Navy is to protect America.  
And if required, to fight and win.  
And through time, there have been clearly visible
transactions that have built our reputation.

- At-sea battles and amphibious landings
in the Pacific during World War Two; 

- Missile strikes from ships at sea into Baghdad
to help liberate Kuwait or to take out
terrorist cells in Afghanistan; 

- Humanitarian relief operations in Indonesia,
Thailand and many other countries
after the 2004 Tsunami; 

- The rescue of Captain Phillips from Somali pirates; 

- The raid that brought down Osama bin Laden 

- Navy Medal of Honor recipient Senior Chief
Edward Byers and his rescue of an American
hostage in Afghanistan. 

We demonstrate our competence to the American public
and to the world during each transaction.

But even as powerful as those events are,
they wouldn’t be able to help the Navy build trust
without some level of transparency
so our customers could see those actions,
understand their context
and make their own decision
on whether the Navy is meeting the standard.

The Navy's customer is the American people,
so we must communicate with them
to close this transactional loop
and, hopefully, over time, build trust
and understanding.

This is my job for the Navy.
And to do it properly,
me and my team of Navy communicators,
develop relationships with a host of partners
and stakeholders:
the media, other government agencies,
elected officials, business, local communities
and non-governmental organizations.

In a lot of ways,
working with and building trust
with all those different groups
is like building peer trust
on Uber, Airbnb or Etsy.  

Except instead of an online collection
of reviews and ratings,
you build a chain of trust
linked by personal and professional relationships
and grounded by character and competence.

This chain of trust
starts by extending your own trust
to someone you don’t know
or maybe only know by reputation.

You then have to understand
the role they play
and their expectation
for whatever transaction
you’re working to achieve.  
To do that,
you have to demonstrate respect,
seek to understand their environment,
their language and their culture.  

And you have to be real.
Being authentic and transparent
is key to building trust.

All this takes time:
Whether it’s building
your personal reputation online,
or demonstrating your competence
through consistently solid work
and showcasing your character
through choices made
when nobody's watching.

All of this became very evident to me
-- and life changing important
to a group of reporters back in 2011.

I was on the USS Mount Whitney,
the command ship for the Navy’s SIXTH FLEET.

My job was to explain to the media
and to the public what we were doing and why.  
Now, this is fairly straight-forward
when it’s just the U.S. Navy.  

But this was OPERATION ODYSSEY DAWN
-- a multi-agency,  multinational task force
brought together initially
to conduct humanitarian missions in Libya.  
The scope of the mission changed
from non-kinetic humanitarian evacuation flights
to kinetic attacks against Gaddafi's military forces
to stop human rights abuses.

Because I needed to provide context
about what was happening on the ground,
I had to fully understand the why’s behind
the kinetic operation.
To do that,
I needed to build a relationship with the Targeteer
-- the person responsible
for selecting air campaign targets
based on intelligence reports.

And since I was the person providing information
to the media, the Targeteer had an interest
to ensure I had all the right information
and a full understanding of what was going on.

So we began to work together.
I asked probably an annoying amount of questions
about his job.
He asked about the challenges of mine.

We both sought to understand
each other’s world better.
We had lunch and talked about our families.
We told each other stories.

Through all this interaction
-- professional and personal --
I was able to see the Targeteer’s
character and competence.
He was able to assess mine.

I extended trust.
I listened to and sought to understand
his role and his expectations for my mine.
I was me -- my authentic self, warts and all.

And in a short amount of time,
we developed mutual trust.

The same pattern had been repeated
over and over again with members of the media
throughout my career.  
Since I had been stationed
in the Pentagon multiple times,
I had solid relationships
with many in the Pentagon Press Corps.

The trust I had developed
with them became incredibly important
during Operation Odyssey Dawn.  
In my mind, that trust contributed
to probably one of the most
important decisions I ever made.

A Pentagon Press Corps reporter
I had known for many years called me
and after our initial greetings and how are you’s,
 his voice got real serious.

“So Dawn, I just wanted to let you know
that we have a group of reporters
traveling with Gaddafi’s forces
from city A to city B tonight.
They’re being taken
in white vans
to see a supposed bombing site….”

Without saying it, but, you know,
kind of saying it, this reporter
was telling me this information
because he knew me
and knew I’d get it to the right people
in order to keep the reporters
in those vans safe.  

You see, Gaddafi had been moving
his military forces,
weapons and ammo around
from city to city in white vans.  

They were legitimate targets
and Gaddafi knew it’d be a propaganda victory
if the West mistakenly killed a group of reporters.
So he was playing a sort of white van shell game
with reporters and his military.

During that day’s targeting meeting,
white vans from city A to city B
were on the target list.  

My heart started pounding.
Could it be the vans with those reporters?
Can we turn off these strikes?
What if the vans
are carrying Gaddafi’s troops instead?

I talked to the Targeteer.
Explained what I knew
and how I knew it. Transparency.
And the strikes were turned off.  
The reporters made it safely
to a site Gaddafi said was bombed
by the West
and where many civilians were killed. Not true.

And I felt an incredible sense of relief.  
Fear did not grip me. We did the right thing.

And even without shared cultures
and shared missions and purpose,
the media and the military trusted each other.  
And we did the right thing.
If you think about it,
a lot of chains of trust were flexed that night.

The reporters on the ground in Libya
trusted someone in the Pentagon Press Corps.
That reporter trusted me.
I trusted the Targeteer
and he, in turn, trusted me.

Mutual respect.
Understanding.
Trust.
  
It all counts
--- whether you’re flying in helicopters,
trying to catch a ride on Uber,
renting a house on Airbnb
or working in a combat zone
-- developing trust
is the most important thing
we can ever do with each other.

Thank you.
