<pre>
Thank you.  
What an incredible honor to be here this morning.

Thank you [introduction]
and a very big thank you to [coordinator]
for this amazing program.

As I was looking through the schedule of events,
I saw you have a session later today called
“Lifting Up the Next Generation of Women”.
A diverse panel of
smart, strong and dedicated Navy leaders --
all of whom are women  --
are leading that discussion.

I believe it’s an incredibly important topic
because, if there’s anything I’ve learned
in my 26 years of Naval service,
it's none of us get where we’re at
alone.

And in my life, perhaps
one of the most personally rewarding challenges
I faced came
not from a war,
not on the ocean,
and not in the corridors of the Pentagon.

It came from completing a
12-mile
Icy-water
Mud-packed
Electric-shock-filled
“Why am I doing this?”
extreme endurance event.

[pause]

With a group of Swim Moms.

Before I did that event,
I could have never imagined myself participating
in an extreme obstacle course.

I don’t like mud.
I don’t like being cold.
and I don’t particularly like being shocked.  
By anything.

But there we were.  
I was watching my daughters Alexis, then 16,
Shannon and Danielle, my twins, then 13,
at swim team practice in Naples, Italy
and I agreed to join a team of Swim Moms
to do an upcoming Tough Mudder in London.

	PREPARATION/GOALS
	---
</p>

<pre>
I need to be honest with you all,
I was scared to death
about running that course.

I had no idea
what I was really getting myself into
but I knew I wanted to train hard
and prepare myself for that event.

I had to make a very conscious decision
to make time to do this --
you know, life gets crazy-busy
with work,
three girls,
a husband
and a dog.

But
I chose
to make this a priority
because
I wanted this for me
and our team.

Goals are important to me.  
I believe it’s important to clearly identify
what you want to achieve.

If you can envision the end-state you desire,
you can then focus
your energy and efforts to achieve it.

I also believe that the best goals
need to be big.
They should be challenging and feel
just out of reach.

For this Tough Mudder, our goal was
to simply finish the event.

Just committing to this
pushed us
out of our comfort zone.
We weren’t extreme racers.
We weren’t fitness fanatics.

We were swim Moms.  
and, in the end,
we wanted to finish together.

	DEFINING DEFEAT
	---
	</p>
<pre>
With the concept of success
clear in my mind,
I next needed to identify
what defeat would look like.

You see, when setting big,
ambitious goals --
When shooting for your own “Moonshot” --
It’s quite possible
you won’t achieve the stated goal.

And that’s okay.
It doesn’t mean defeat.
The journey itself has
immense value.

To help deal
with all the setbacks in life --
To help understand
it’s okay to try,
fail and then try again --

To help condition ourselves to
an iterative approach
to attaining our goals
through trial and error,
we have to accept that
small failures are part of the process,
and those failures don’t equal defeat.

You see,
defeat is a mindset.
It happens when you’ve given up
and can’t find a lesson
to learn in the experience,
and can’t find
any value in the journey.

Our group of Swim Moms knew
we might not be able to
complete every race obstacle.
We knew someone could get hurt
and not be able to finish.

And we knew
that if we faced
any of those challenges,
We’d be disappointed,
But not defeated.

Success for us was to finish the course
on our own terms,
within our own abilities.

Defeat could only occur if
we didn’t even try,
or
if we didn’t help each other
be
our best self
on that day.

So I trained.

We
would not
be
defeated.

	LIFTING EACH OTHER UP
	---
	</p>
<pre>
In the end though,
none of my training
prepared me for that course.

The obstacles were more challenging
than I’d thought.
The water much colder
than I thought I could handle.
The distance felt much, much, much longer
than the stated 12 miles.

But
we pushed and pulled,
Lifted and motivated each other
with
words
and interlocked arms.

Each of us made a choice
time after time
to continue on
And earn each step
Conquer each obstacle
And do something we weren’t 100% sure
we could do.

We chose to lean on each other
when needed
And support each other
when called upon
to finish
as a team.


It’s been like that
throughout my career in the Navy too.

All my successes are because someone --
	a strong mentor,
	a caring shipmate,
	a cohort of women facing the same challenges,
	opportunities and choices as me,
Helped me on the way.

It is important for
all of us
to build
plenty of time into our days and weeks
for our families,
and for us to cultivate and grow
strong and enduring relationships
with a highly diverse group
of shipmates and friends.

These relationships,
built
on a foundation of
trust, empathy, respect and synergy,
and a belief that
the more you give to others
the more you’ll receive back in life,
provide a strong support network,
with a deep bench of
knowledge, experiences, and perspectives
to guide, correct, lift, push and pull
us when needed in life.

I am proud of my service to the U.S. Navy
and I feel good about
my personal accomplishments,

But what makes me most proud,
touches me to my soul
and rewards me beyond
any personal accomplishment,
is knowing I’ve helped others.

Knowing I’ve helped others
through challenging moments
in their lives,

over obstacles they thought
they couldn’t pass,

and with choices that seemed
impossible to navigate,

Those are what I count
as my most rewarding successes.

It is meaningless to reach the top of anything
and stand there alone.

There is no victory
if there is no one to share it with.

And no victory is worth celebrating
If you can’t help others join you at the top.

	Conclusion
	---
	</p>
<pre>
Climbing up that Tough Mudder wall was like that.
It took all of us to make it up that
muddy, slippery, seemingly impossible obstacle.

We pushed and pulled each other up
and over.
It took time. And many falls.
But we did it.

And when the last of us reached that top --
we knew
we could do
anything.

As I look around this room,
I see an amazing group of Servicewomen,
and opportunity after opportunity
for each of you to add to your own network
of diverse friends, shipmates and mentors.

All that’s left
is to choose your next big goal;
To set your own ‘Moonshot’;
start working to achieve it.

And help others achieve theirs.

To push and pull,
Lift and motivate each other
Help with the next step
and guide someone over their next obstacle.

If you’re first to the top,
reach down and pull someone up with you.

And if you’re still climbing and someone is ahead,
do what you can
to push them further.

We’re in this together…
and we can all reach the top
-- achieve our goals --
by Lifting Up  and helping
the Next Generation Of Women Leaders.

Thank you.
