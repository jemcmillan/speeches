	Introduction
	---
	</p>
<pre>
Thank you for that introduction.
Let’s start with a joke:

Cortana, Alexa and Siri were having
a conversation with each other.

Cortana said:  
“You know, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian
are examples of negative-concord languages.”

Alexa retorted:  
“Actually, Russian, Neapolitan and English
are also languages where multiple negatives
affirm each other.”

Cortana then replied,
“Oh yeah,  well, there's no language
where a double positive makes a negative.”

Siri chimes in: “Yeah, right.”

Appears their databases weren't aligned.

	Not-so-social communicator

	</p>
<pre>
In addition to not being able to tell a joke,  
I am probably not the best person to talk
about the future of communication.

I've deleted my Instagram from my phone,
my last Tweet was April 16
and my last Facebook post was June 14.  

My Snapchat Score is 76
and I have only four trophies.

By all metrics you could use,
I'm a communicator who doesn't communicate
the way people are communicating today.

So, my starting point isn’t normal.

To talk about what’s next
for our community,
I think we need to break it down into
The Near Future and
The Far Future

	The Near Future
	---
	</p>
<pre>
The MC merger prepared us well for the
online, social, video and multimedia storytelling
we’ve seen and continue to see
in the communication space.

Today, a large portion of our work is about
our people and our events.
It’s media coverage based off
the principles of news gathering, reporting
and feature storytelling.

This focus has served us well.  
Our commanders in the Fleet have
encouraged, expected, and
eventually exulted our work.

Armed with an MC, their command could
get the recognition they deserve.

But the tools of technology today
are minimizing the need to have
a professional take photographs,
post a quick video,
or send a note back home to the family
on the command social media page.

All of us know that we need
a professional force of communicators
To uphold standards of
security, accuracy, propriety and policy.

But as the military budgets get tighter,
as manpower gets reduced,
and tough decisions
about what to keep or lose
encroach on our community,
we will need to be more
than the Sailors who
cover people and events.

In the near future,
our focus needs to shift
to becoming the Sailors
who use communication
to directly help
solve command issues and problems.

We must be able to add direct value
to achieving the commander’s intent.  
At all levels within the organization.

To help us shift our focus,
we are introducing
a communication model
that focuses on understanding
the commander’s intent;
defining the issue to solve;
coming up with multiple ways
of solving that issue
through communication;
creating the content
and then evaluating the effects.  

It’s called the DICE model.
D for Define,
I for ideate solutions,
C for create content
and E for evaluate effects.  

In addition to a slightly
different approach to
our thinking process,
the near future will bring
better communication tools
and techniques.

We will work with a new Navy
content publishing system
that brings all our content pieces
into one place that is
structured;
search engine optimized;
publishes to a unit’s social media platform;
and is adaptable and responsive
so it’ll work on any device -
desktop, mobile, wearable,
virtual or augmented reality.

Our web developers at DMA
just recently coded Navy.mil so
our news stories show up
as Facebook Instant Articles.  
The presentation is amazing and fast.  

Our near future will require us to
rapidly update our digital tools
and work flow process
to adapt to new ways
of presenting information.

As we focus on the commander’s intent
and communicate targeted,
more specific information,
more of our work will center
around collecting facts and data
and cleaning and ordering that information
for use in releasable data sets,
data-driven stories,
infographics and visualizations.

Our skills as information designers
-- the practice of presenting information
in a way that fosters efficient
and effective understanding of it --
will become key to the Navy.

	The Far Future
	---
	</p>
<pre>
So the near future isn’t too different.  
It’s just better.

But the far future
is going to get a little weird.
It’s where everything changes.

In the far future,
Artificial Intelligence systems
will talk to each other
and share their knowledge.  

Microsoft’s  Cortana;
Amazon’s Alexa;
Apple’s Siri;
IBM’s Watson and
Google’s “Hey Google”
and whoever, whatever comes next
will all contribute
knowledge to the internet.

The internet will be everywhere.
It won’t be a place you go.
It will just exist.  
In our cars, our home appliances,
our lights, our contact lenses.

It will exist just about everywhere
as sensors become routine parts
of tools, toys, tableware.

Whatever can be measured
and provide data
will be connected.

The internet of things will
measure, record, and report
everything.

And machine learning systems
will take in all that data
process, perceive
and realign algorithms
to increase effectiveness
and efficiencies.

Already, Automated Insights
is changing the content world
with their program called
“WordSmith” -
An artificial intelligence platform
that generates human-sounding
narratives from data.  

Their website says their program created
over one billion pieces of targeted,
personalized content just last year.  

You’ve probably seen their work --
AP, the Associated Press,
uses WordSmith for
much of their financial news.  
Yahoo! uses it for their Fantasy sports content.

A Google engineer gave a TED Talk in May
called “How computers are learning to be creative.”  
He demonstrated how Google’s AI can understand
what it sees by mimicking how the brain functions.  

A device points at a bird and the AI says
that’s a bird and can then
even identify the species.

But the AI can also reverse the process.  
Take all it knows about how to identify a bird
and output a likeness of a bird
from nothing but data.  
Like output a bird
from computer memories.

Research and development of
autonomous drones and advanced robotics;
digital modeling and fabrication,
to include 3D printing;
virtual and augmented reality;
biotechnology and bioinformatics;
and nanotechnology
will change everything in the far future.

The CNO was just in the Silicon Valley
and visited Singularity University
where they are
researching, prototyping and developing
all this and more now.

The University takes its name from the concept
called the Technological Singularity,
where computers
and AI possess a superintelligence
that far distances themselves
from human intelligence
and no longer need humans
to guide their own
machine learning.

This is where the rate
of technological advance grows
exponentially.

And don’t worry,
when this Singularity happens
it’s not going to turn into something
like Skynet from the Terminator movies.

It’s actually more freaky than that.

Inventor and futurist Ray Kurtzveil
gave a TED Talk in 2014 about Hybrid Thinking
where he predicts we’re going to be able to expand
our neocortex -- the part of our brain
that handles sensory perception, spatial reasoning,
conscious thought and language --
with nanobots that connect our own neocortex
to the cloud -- to the internet.

We will all have the potential
to tap into the singularity,
to join in any conversation
with Cortana, Alexa or Siri.

	---
	What does it all mean?
	---
	</p>
<pre>
What does all this mean for us?  

It means your Navy is going to change
dramatically during your career.

I believe the Near Future is now
and will continue for five to ten years.  

Then the far future arrives,
the pace of change accelerates
and within 15 to 20 years,
our world will be completely different
in ways we can’t imagine.

The tools we use will change.  

Machines will perform the repetitive tasks
we do today faster and better.  
Basic news writing, captioning images,
sending updates to families,
documenting daily military life and operations.

Sensors, cameras and microphones
will be everywhere and will be fed back
to collection points to be run through algorithms
to determine what to do with it all.

This is where I believe our job
will take on incredible importance.  

Trained communicators, designers, photographers,
writers and multimedia storytellers
will instruct the machines on what is important
to pull from the exabytes of data
and share with leaders, families and friends.

We will need trained storytellers
to extract information from massive datasets
of images, audio and video files and transcripts.  

And from that mountain of data, tell a story.

Throughout time, no matter what technological
revolution occurred,
humans have relied on stories
to teach, motivate, and inspire.

So no matter what happens
in the near or far future,

The Navy will always need talented storytellers.

The tools may change over time.  
The focus of our efforts may also change.
But the need for story does not.

Happy 10th Anniversary MCs!

Continue to find, tell and share incredible stories.
Push the boundaries of our tools and our craft.

I can’t wait to see
what you all will do with the next ten years!

Thank you.
