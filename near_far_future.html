<p class="speech">
		Thank you for that introduction.
		Let’s start with a joke:
</p>

<p class="speech">
Cortana, Alexa and Siri were having
a conversation with each other.
</p>

<p class="speech">
Cortana said:  
“You know, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian
are examples of negative-concord languages.”
</p>

<p class="speech">
Alexa retorted:  
“Actually, Russian, Neapolitan and English
are also languages where multiple negatives
affirm each other.”
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Cortana then replied,
	“Oh yeah,  well, there's no language
	where a double positive makes a negative.”
</p>

<p class="speech">
Siri chimes in: “Yeah, right.”
</p>

<p class="speech">
Appears their databases weren't aligned.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="speech">
	In addition to not being able to tell a joke,  
	I am probably not the best person to talk
	about the future of communication.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	I've deleted my Instagram from my phone,
	my last Tweet was April 16
	and my last Facebook post was June 14.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	My Snapchat Score is 76
	and I have only four trophies.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	By all metrics you could use,
	I'm a communicator who doesn't communicate
	the way people are communicating today.
</p>

<p class="speech">
So, my starting point isn’t normal.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	To talk about what’s next
	for our community,
	I think we need to break it down into
	The Near Future and
	The Far Future.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="speech">
	The MC merger prepared us well for the
	online, social, video and multimedia storytelling
	we’ve seen and continue to see
	in the communication space.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Today, a large portion of our work is about
	our people and our events.
	It’s media coverage based off
	the principles of news gathering, reporting
	and feature storytelling.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	This focus has served us well.  
	Our commanders in the Fleet have
	encouraged, expected, and
	eventually exulted our work.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Armed with an MC, their command could
	get the recognition they deserve.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	But the tools of technology today
	are minimizing the need to have
	a professional take photographs,
	post a quick video,
	or send a note back home to the family
	on the command social media page.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	All of us know that we need
	a professional force of communicators
	To uphold standards of
	security, accuracy, propriety and policy.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	But as the military budgets get tighter,
	as manpower gets reduced,
	and tough decisions
	about what to keep or lose
	encroach on our community,
	we will need to be more
	than the Sailors who
	cover people and events.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	In the near future,
	our focus needs to shift
	to becoming the Sailors
	who use communication
	to directly help
	solve command issues and problems.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	We must be able to add direct value
	to achieving the commander’s intent.  
	At all levels within the organization.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	To help us shift our focus,
	we are introducing
	a communication model
	that focuses on understanding
	the commander’s intent;
	defining the issue to solve;
	coming up with multiple ways
	of solving that issue
	through communication;
	creating the content
	and then evaluating the effects.
</p>

<p class="speech">
		It’s called the DICE model.
</p>

<ul class="speech">
	<li class="space">D for Define</li>
	<li class="space">I for ideate solutions</li>
	<li class="space">C for create content</li>
	<li class="space">E for evaluate effects</li>
</ul>

<p class="speech">
	In addition to a slightly
	different approach to
	our thinking process,
	the near future will bring
	better communication tools
	and techniques.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	We will work with a new Navy
	content publishing system
	that brings all our content pieces
	into one place that is
	structured;
	search engine optimized;
	publishes to a unit’s social media platform;
	and is adaptable and responsive
	so it’ll work on any device -
	desktop, mobile, wearable,
	virtual or augmented reality.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Our web developers at DMA
	just recently coded Navy.mil so
	our news stories show up
	as Facebook Instant Articles.  
	The presentation is amazing and fast.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Our near future will require us to
	rapidly update our digital tools
	and work flow process
	to adapt to new ways
	of presenting information.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	As we focus on the commander’s intent
	and communicate targeted,
	more specific information,
	more of our work will center
	around collecting facts and data
	and cleaning and ordering that information
	for use in releasable data sets,
	data-driven stories,
	infographics and visualizations.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Our skills as information designers
	-- the practice of presenting information
	in a way that fosters efficient
	and effective understanding of it --
	will become key to the Navy.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="speech">
	So the near future isn’t too different.  
	It’s just better.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	But the far future
	is going to get a little weird.
	It’s where everything changes.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	In the far future,
	Artificial Intelligence systems
	will talk to each other
	and share their knowledge.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Microsoft’s  Cortana;
	Amazon’s Alexa;
	Apple’s Siri;
	IBM’s Watson and
	Google’s “Hey Google”
	and whoever, whatever comes next
	will all contribute
	knowledge to the internet.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	The internet will be everywhere.
	It won’t be a place you go.
	It will just exist.  
	In our cars, our home appliances,
	our lights, our contact lenses.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	It will exist just about everywhere
	as sensors become routine parts
	of tools, toys, tableware.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Whatever can be measured
	and provide data
	will be connected.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	The internet of things will
	measure, record, and report
	everything.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	And machine learning systems
	will take in all that data
	process, perceive
	and realign algorithms
	to increase effectiveness
	and efficiencies.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Already, Automated Insights
	is changing the content world
	with their program called
	“WordSmith” -
	An artificial intelligence platform
	that generates human-sounding
	narratives from data.  
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Their website says their program created
	over one billion pieces of targeted,
	personalized content just last year.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	You’ve probably seen their work --
	AP, the Associated Press,
	uses WordSmith for
	much of their financial news.  
	Yahoo! uses it for their Fantasy sports content.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	A Google engineer gave a TED Talk in May
	called “How computers are learning to be creative.”  
	He demonstrated how Google’s AI can understand
	what it sees by mimicking how the brain functions.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	A device points at a bird and the AI says
	that’s a bird and can then
	even identify the species.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	But the AI can also reverse the process.  
	Take all it knows about how to identify a bird
	and output a likeness of a bird
	from nothing but data.  
	Like output a bird
	from computer memories.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Research and development of
	autonomous drones and advanced robotics;
	digital modeling and fabrication,
	to include 3D printing;
	virtual and augmented reality;
	biotechnology and bioinformatics;
	and nanotechnology
	will change everything in the far future.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	The CNO was just in the Silicon Valley
	and visited Singularity University
	where they are
	researching, prototyping and developing
	all this and more now.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	The University takes its name from the concept
	called the Technological Singularity,
	where computers
	and AI possess a superintelligence
	that far distances themselves
	from human intelligence
	and no longer need humans
	to guide their own
	machine learning.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	This is where the rate
	of technological advance grows
	exponentially.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	And don’t worry,
	when this Singularity happens
	it’s not going to turn into something
	like Skynet from the Terminator movies.
</p>

<p class="speech">
It’s actually more freaky than that.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Inventor and futurist Ray Kurtzveil
	gave a TED Talk in 2014 about Hybrid Thinking
	where he predicts we’re going to be able to expand
	our neocortex -- the part of our brain
	that handles sensory perception, spatial reasoning,
	conscious thought and language --
	with nanobots that connect our own neocortex
	to the cloud -- to the internet.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	We will all have the potential
	to tap into the singularity,
	to join in any conversation
	with Cortana, Alexa or Siri.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="speech">
What does all this mean for us?  
</p>

<p class="speech">
	It means your Navy is going to change
	dramatically during your career.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	I believe the Near Future is now
	and will continue for five to ten years.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Then the far future arrives,
	the pace of change accelerates
	and within 15 to 20 years,
	our world will be completely different
	in ways we can’t imagine.
</p>

<p class="speech">
The tools we use will change.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Machines will perform the repetitive tasks
	we do today faster and better.  
	Basic news writing, captioning images,
	sending updates to families,
	documenting daily military life and operations.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Sensors, cameras and microphones
	will be everywhere and will be fed back
	to collection points to be run through algorithms
	to determine what to do with it all.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	This is where I believe our job
	will take on incredible importance.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Trained communicators, designers, photographers,
	writers and multimedia storytellers
	will instruct the machines on what is important
	to pull from the exabytes of data
	and share with leaders, families and friends.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	We will need trained storytellers
	to extract information from massive datasets
	of images, audio and video files and transcripts.
</p>

<p class="speech">
And from that mountain of data, tell a story.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Throughout time, no matter what technological
	revolution occurred,
	humans have relied on stories
	to teach, motivate, and inspire.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	So no matter what happens
	in the near or far future,
	the Navy will always need talented storytellers.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	The tools may change over time.  
	The focus of our efforts may also change.
	But the need for story does not.
</p>

<p class="speech">
Happy 10th Anniversary MCs!
</p>

<p class="speech">
	Continue to find, tell and share incredible stories.
	Push the boundaries of our tools and our craft.
</p>

<p class="speech">
	I can’t wait to see
	what you all will do with the next ten years!
</p>

<p class="speech">
Thank you.
